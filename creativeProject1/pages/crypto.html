                <h3>WHAT IS A "CRYPTOCURRENCY"</h3>

                <p>A cryptocurrency (often called just a "crypto") is a digital or a virtual currency that is secured by
                    cryptography, which makes it difficult or impossible to conterfeit or
                    double-spend.  Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks that are 
                    based on <a href="../pages/basics.html">blockchain</a> technology.  Cryptocurrencies 
                    often attract users because they are usually decentralized, meaning they are not
                    controlled by one central authority. We will go over a few of the most notable
                    cryptos, where they came from, what they're valued at, and why they're important.

                <h3>BITCOIN</h3>
                <p>
                    Bitcoin was invented and implemented by the person or persons who are pseudonymously as 
                    Satoshi Nakamoto.  Nakamoto published a paper on October 31, 2008 which was titled "Bitcoin: 
                    A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." The first bitcoin transaction on the blockchain was executed
                    and the first block was mined on January 3, 2009.  Initially bitcoin had no monetary value, but the idea 
                    has gained traction and the value of bitcoin has skyrocketed to currenlty be a whopping $38,549 US dollars. 
                    Bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto continues to remain unknown to this day.

                <h3>SHIBA INU</h3>
                <p>
                    The Shiba Inu token is another cryptocurrency that was created by an anonymous group known only as "Ryoshi". The 
                    coin was started in August of 2020 and is known by many as a "meme coin", a cryptocurrency that originated from
                    an internet meme (see Dogecoin).  It is named after the Shiba Inu, a Japanese breed of dog.  In an interesting marketing attempt,
                    the creators of Shiba Inu sent 50% of the Shiba coin to Vitalik Buterin.  Many believe that this was an attempt to 
                    increase trust in the currency, as the founder of a notable currency now held billions of Shiba Inu tokens.  Many are
                    speculative of the success of the Shiba token in the future, but other meme coins have had large increases in value in 
                    the past.
